With tools like Infinite Yield, Bypassed WalkSpeed, Bypassed JumpSpeed, DarkDex v3, and a Chat Bypass, this hub allows you to manipulate various game elements with ease.

## Features

- **Infinite Yield**: Access an advanced admin command system that lets you control the game in many ways (e.g., teleportation, object manipulation).
- **Bypassed WalkSpeed**: Customize your walk speed without hitting Roblox’s limits.
- **Bypassed JumpSpeed**: Modify your jump height with no restrictions, giving you more control over your movement.
- **DarkDex v3**: A powerful executor with a simple interface that lets you execute custom scripts easily.
- **Chat Bypass**: Send chat messages without the usual filtering and character limits.

## Installation

### Requirements
To use **UniversalRYZ**, you will need a Roblox script executor. Here are the recommended executors:

- [Wave](https://getwave.gg/) – A robust and reliable script executor.
- [Solara](https://getsolara.dev/) – A lightweight and fast executor for Roblox scripts.

### Steps to Use

1. **Download UniversalRYZ**  
   - Download the latest **UniversalRYZ** script from the repository.
   - Extract the files to a location of your choice.

2. **Open Roblox and Load a Game**  
   - Launch Roblox and join any game where you want to use the script.

3. **Inject the Executor**  
   - Open your chosen executor (Wave or Solara) and inject it into Roblox.
   - Load the **UniversalRYZ** script into the executor and run it.

4. **Execute the Script**  
   - Once executed, the UniversalRYZ hub will open in the game, and you can access all of its features.

## Usage

Once the script is running, you will have access to the following features:

### Infinite Yield
- Open the **Infinite Yield** console by typing `/admin` in the game chat (or use the designated hotkey).
- Use the commands in the console to control various aspects of the game, such as teleporting, changing game settings, and more.

### WalkSpeed and JumpSpeed Bypass
- To adjust your walking speed, use the command `!walkspeed [value]` in the console.
- To change your jump speed, use the command `!jumpspeed [value]`.
- These commands will bypass any game-imposed limits, allowing for fast movement and high jumps.

### DarkDex v3
- DarkDex v3 allows you to manipulate the game’s elements with ease.
- Access it through the hub interface, and choose from a variety of options to execute custom scripts and commands.

### Chat Bypass
- The **Chat Bypass** allows you to send any message, even if it exceeds Roblox's usual limits or bypasses its built-in filters.
- Simply type your message in the chat box, and hit send. The message will be sent without restrictions.
